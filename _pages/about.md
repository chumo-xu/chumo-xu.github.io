I'm a last year MRes student from [Hamlyn Center for Robotic Surgery](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/hamlyn-centre/), [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning and 4D reconstruction.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Daniel Elson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SnuIIlsAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Baoru Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=unbPvWAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
